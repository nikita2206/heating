        help
            Select which OpenTherm implementation to use.
            
            - RMT: Uses ESP32's RMT peripheral for hardware-timed encoding/decoding
            - Library: Uses the Arduino-based opentherm_library (ihormelnyk)

        config OPENTHERM_IMPL_RMT
            bool "RMT (Hardware-based)"
            help
                Use the RMT peripheral-based implementation.
                Provides hardware-timed pulse generation and automatic edge timestamping.

        config OPENTHERM_IMPL_LIBRARY
            bool "Arduino Library"
            help
                Use the Arduino-based opentherm_library implementation.
                Requires Arduino framework as a dependency.
